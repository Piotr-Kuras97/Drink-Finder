Hello, 

this is my next project, during which I mainly focused on check my JS skills and to try the fetch function. Additionally I wanted to make project using object-oriented programming. I used a public available datebase from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

You can see my project here -> https://piotr-kuras97.github.io/Drink-Finder/
